# coinConvert

This application was built using React Native. This cross-platform framework enables seamless development for both iOS and Android, offering a single codebase for efficient and consistent app deployment. 
The project incorporates Axios, a JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests. Also, the component Picker that enables the selection of options from a dropdown menu. This component is particularly useful for providing a streamlined and interactive way for users to choose from a predefined set of options, such as a list of items, categories, or values.
